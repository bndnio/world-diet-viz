## World Diet Viz

### Summary

This project was built for UVic's information visualization class with the intention to understand how diet composition impacts mean age of death around the world.

Data was assembled from various data dumps provided by the World Health Organizations, in particular the Food and Aggriculture Organization.

We found that there was no real correlation. However, this in itself is interesting because it suggests that diet is not the predominant factor in the increasing life expectancy around the world.
